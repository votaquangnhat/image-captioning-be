# Image captioning back-end

This repository is part of a team project for the course Introduction to Deep Learning at SoICT. It loads a pre-trained model and generates captions for images received from the front-end via Flask.

The model checkpoints are stored in the drive https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14YwsskmkFAd4_RlXLIQ-CBOtrjQTsbMl
